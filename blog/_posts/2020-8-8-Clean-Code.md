## Avoid Mental Mapping
    Some times people like to use abstract loop and mapping by a single letter x or n or any other. 

    Then it would be very simple in the loop but is hard for others to read.

    Some smart programmers wants to show off that they can use mental mapping, But this is not decent in the team work.

> One difference between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that the professional understands that clarity is king. Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand.
