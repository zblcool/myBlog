## SQL Commands

### CREATE DATABASE

- \q to quit
- \l list all the databases
- CREATE DATABASE test;

### Connect to databases

- Psql -h local host -p 5432 -U amigoscode test
- \c test is also connect to a database (after \l)
  
### Dangerous command

```sql
CREATE DATABASE test
DROP DATABASE test; // drop all of datas
```

### CREATE TABEL

```sql
CREATE TAVLE table_name (
Column name + data type + constraints if any
)
\d d for describe
\d test // show test table contents
```

Should you use constraints ?

### INSERT INTO

```sql
INSERT INTO test ( first name,lastname)
VALUE (‘jane’,’jones’);
```
	
	
### Generate 1000 rows into using mockaroo

	a. Provides random data
	b. Using \i
	c. Pwd to show. Route

### Select from

### Order by

- 12345 ASC
- 54321 DESC
	
```sql
SELECT * form person ORDER BY first_name ASC;
SELECT * form person ORDER BY first_name, birth ASC;
```

### DISTINCT 

```sql
	 SELECT country_name from person  // will show all the results in country_name
	 SELECT DISTINCT country_name from person. // only show one times if is same country
```

### WHERE

```sql
	 SELECT * form person WHERE gender = ‘MALE’;
	 SELECT * form person WHERE gender =‘male’ AND (countryName = ‘Poland’ or countryName =‘China ‘) ;
```

### Comparison operators 

```sql
	SELECT 1 >= 2; 	// will return f
	SELECT 1 <= 2;  	// will return t
	SELECT 1 <> 2;	// t <> means not equal 
```

### Limit / Offset keywords
 LIMIT is widely use , but it is not an official way . However . FETCH is

 ```sql
    SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 10; // select first 10 rows
    SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 5; // select first 5 rows
    
    SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5; // select from 6 to the follow rows
 
    SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 FETCH FIRST 5 ROW ONLY; // select first 5 rows. OFFICIAL WAY !! 
```

### “IN”  use a "set" to enhance the ability of  WHERE Normally we can use this way to find out the items in the table 
 
```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth = ‘China’
OR country_of_birth = ‘France” OR country_of_birth = ‘Brazil”;
```
 
> BUT we can use this 
 
```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth IN (‘China’,’Brazil’,’France’); // we can also add ORDER BY for next sentence  if don’t add ";"  

ORDER BY country_of_birth;
```


## Week 4 lecture

### GROUP BY

```sql
```

### Aggregate fuctions

```SQL
SELECT AVG(shrdiv) AS avgdiv FROM shr;
SELECT AVG(shrdiv/shrprice*100) AS avgdic FROM shr;
```

### Subqueris

```sql
SELECT shrfirm, shrpe FROM shr WHERE
shrpe > (
		SELECT AVG(shrpe) FROM shr
);
```

>dont read from top , first read inside

```sql
SELECT pizza,price
FROM menu
WHERE price >= ALL (
	SELECT price
	FROM menu WHERE country = ‘italy’
);
```

### ANY operator

### Self-Join

Join a table to itself


***
  

## WEEK4 TUT

### Show the number of missions flown in each year. Order by the launch year

```sql

SELECT projectname,launchyear, count(*) AS missions FROM nasa2_mission GROUP BY projectname, launchyear ORDER BY launchyear;

```

### Select all projects and the number of missions in each project, for all projects with more than one mission. With the given data.

```sql
SELECT projectname, count(*) AS number_missions from nasa2_mission GROUP BY projectname having count(*) > 1;
```

### Select every astronaut who flew more than one mission. Give the name, number of missions.

```sql
select astroname, count(*) as missions FROM nasa2_astronaut natural join nasa2_
assigned GROUP BY astroname having count(*) > 1
```
>having is pretty useful 
>>count(*) should be careful here

### Show the number of astronauts born each year.

```sql
SELECT birth,count(*) FROM nasa2_astronaut GROUP BY birth;
```

### Show the number of different craft that have flown across all missions.
```sql
SELECT missiontype, count(*) FROM nasa2_mission GROUP BY missiontype;
```

### Show the number of mission types that have flown across all missions.

！TODO
### COPY to

```sql
\copy (select * FROM nasa_projects) to test_projects.csv
```
>so i can save the result of the query in () as a csv file

## WEEK  5 TUT

### JOIN

[Different types of Join](https://w3resource.com/PostgreSQL/postgresql-join.php)

### NATURAL JOIN

- If there is same colum, using NATURE JOIN

```sql

select * from menu natural join recipe order by pizza;

```

### INNER JOIN

```sql

select * from menu INNER JOIN recipe using(pizza);

```

### Cross product

There are two ways of using cross product.

```sql
select * from menu , recipe;
```

> get every combines that can be combined

```sql
select * from menu , recipe where menu.pizza = recipe.pizza;
```

>same result with Natural join 

## Test sample 3

### Question 1

```sql
select astroname, death, (death - birth) as age FROM nasa2_astronaut WHERE death >= 1960 and death =< 1970 ORDER BY death;
```
