### Discrete Mathematics

- sets relations proof methods
  
### Discrete Mathematical Structures

- numbers graphs trees counting

### Discrete Probability Theory

### What dose Discrete means

- the ability to discreting

## Proofs

- $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ in a triangle
- the interesting thing between Graph and Caculate. Elegant and correct
- but something lack of the infomations
  
> Roots of $ax^2 + bx + c => [-b +-\sqrt{(b^2-4ac)}]/2a$  
> "$a !== 0  D !==0$"

## Proof by contradiction

### make a suppose eg

- Is $\sqrt[3]{1332} <= 11$?
- if so $1332<=1231$ this is not true
- so $\sqrt[3]{1332} > 11$
  
### If an assertion implies something false then the

assertion itself must be false

### $\sqrt2$ is irrational

- suppose$\sqrt2$ was rational
- so have n d intergers without common prime fators such that $\sqrt2 = n/d$
- so n and  d are even
- $\sqrt2 = n/d $
- $2d^2 = n^2$
- so $n$ is even
