# Intro

## *Classes*

    create classes to store the elements of the CG(computer graphics) like vector2 vector3 RGB 
  

## *Float or double*

    they have specified scenario to use different ways.
    
like the `double` is for geometric computation  and `floats` for color computation


# linear Algrebra

## dot production
outcome is a number
## cross production
outcome is another value


# Transform 

## View/Camera Transformation
