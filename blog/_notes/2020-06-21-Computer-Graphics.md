# 1. Intro

## 1.1. *Classes*

    create classes to store the elements of the CG(computer graphics) like vector2 vector3 RGB 
  

## 1.2. *Float or double*

    they have specified scenario to use different ways.
    
like the `double` is for geometric computation  and `floats` for color computation


# 2. linear Algrebra

## 2.1. dot production
outcome is a number
## 2.2. cross production
outcome is another value


# 3. Transform 

## 3.1. View/Camera Transformation
