    If anybody asks you ‘What is Quality all about’ the answer is MONEY 

-  quality constantly changes and improves as lessons are learned.


- Quality is important to business because it  means money
- Quality is a whole of business process/behaviour
- Testing checks the level of quality – it does not create it
- ICT is part of the business – it supports everything in the business
- Planning tests is essential – no matter how complex the system you must plan your tests
- People are vital components of any Quality Test team
